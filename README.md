# My React Project
Welcome to the client side of my react project assessment. 
I made use of React-redux for my state management. 
I also used firebase to store my cart items, so as to be able to retrieve on reload or relogin.


# To run the client side 
I used yarn as my package manager
Make sure you are on the ecommerce-app folder on the terminal
On your terminal, type yarn (to include the node_modles)
Afer completion, type yarn start (to start the app)

(before you run the client side make sure you have run the server side. (Go to the README on the server side to know how to run the server))


Thank you!
